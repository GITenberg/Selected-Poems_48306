<div class="line"><span>Desire illimitable, and still content,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>And all dear names men use, to cheat despair,</span></div>

<div class="line"><span>My night shall be remembered for a star</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>That outshone all the suns of all men's days.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Shall I not crown them with immortal praise</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Whom I have loved, who have given me, dared with me</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>High secrets, and in darkness knelt to see</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>The inenarrable godhead of delight?</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Love is a flame:—we have beaconed the world's night.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>A city:—and we have built it, these and I.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>An emperor:—we have taught the world to die.</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>So, for their sakes I loved, ere I go hence,</span></div>

<p class="pfirst"><span>"The volume of 'Poems' published in 1911, which
contains work written as early as 1905, when he was
eighteen, shows an art curiously personal, skilful,
deliberate.  It shows, too, an intellectual deftness altogether
unexpected in so young a poet, and it shows finally, not
always but often, an indifference to the normal material
upon which poets good and bad are apt to work from the
outset, and in the shaping of which ultimately comes all
poetry that is memorable.  Nearly every page is interesting
on account of its art and intellectual deftness, qualities
that we should not expect to be marked....</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"... Even in the poems where most we feel the lack
of emotional truth there is a beauty of word that made
the book full of the most exciting promise.  Already,
too there was in certain poems assurance against the
danger that this intellectual constraint might degenerate
into virtuosity."—From "RUPERT BROOKE," by John

<p class="pfirst"><span>"To those of us who see in poetry the perfect flowering
of life, the story of Rupert Brooke will always mean
chiefly the score or so of poems in which he reached to
the full maturity of his genius and gave imperishable
expression to the very heart of his personality....
Not even the fact that the man who wrote the sonnets,
than which after long generations nothing shall make
the year 1914 more memorable, served and died for
England at war, can add one beat to their pulse.  The
poetry that shines and falls across them in one perfect
and complete wave is, as poetry must always be,
independent of all factual experience, and comes wholly from
the deeper experience of the imagination."—From

nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,

<p class="pfirst"><strong class="bold">1.A.</strong><span> By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by
the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">1.B.</strong><span> “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™ electronic
works. See paragraph 1.E below.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">1.C.</strong><span> The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting free
access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™ works
in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the Project
Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily comply with
the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the same format
with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when you share it
without charge with others.</span></p>

<p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">1.D.</strong><span> The copyright laws of the place where you are located also
govern what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most

United States, check the laws of your country in addition to the terms
of this agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work.  The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</span></p>

<p class="pfirst"><span>Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations

assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™'s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain
freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future generations. To

public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing
the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely
distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of
equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to
$5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status
with the IRS.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit </span><a class="reference external" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate">http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate</a></p>
